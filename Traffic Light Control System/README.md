# Traffic Light Control System

A console-based simulation of a Traffic Light Control System written in C. This project demonstrates the implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage signal transitions and time-based logic, a fundamental concept in Embedded Systems and Automotive software development.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: C
- **Key Concepts**: Finite State Machines (FSM), deterministic timing, console I/O, tabular state logic.
- **Platform**: Windows (Console Application)

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites
You need a C compiler installed on your system. Common options for Windows:
- **MinGW (GCC)**
- **Visual Studio (MSVC)**
- **Tiny C Compiler (TCC)**

### Steps
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd "d:\C Projects\Traffic Light Control System"
   ```
3. Compile the code (assuming GCC):
   ```cmd
   gcc main.c -o traffic_light.exe
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```cmd
   .\traffic_light.exe
   ```
5. To stop the simulation, press `Ctrl + C`.
